# Effects of altered inhibition in schizophrenia on stimulus processing in human cortical microcircuits

A project to explore the effects of altering neural inhibition in human cortical microcircuits by implementing a compuational model using [NetPyNe](http://www.netpyne.org/) based on the model implemented in [(Yao et al.)](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(21)01741-1.pdf) and the schizophrenia associated inhibition modeled in [(Metzner and Steuber)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34650135/).
